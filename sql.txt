SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized programming language used to communicate with and manage data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). SQL enables users to create, modify, retrieve, and manage data stored in tables (which are organized as rows and columns) within a database.

Some key features of SQL include:

1. **Data Querying**: SQL allows users to query the database to retrieve specific information using the SELECT statement.

2. **Data Manipulation**: Users can insert, update, and delete data within the database using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

3. **Data Definition**: SQL provides commands to define and modify the structure of database objects, such as tables and indexes, using CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements.

4. **Data Control**: SQL includes features for controlling access to data, such as granting and revoking permissions.

5. **Transaction Management**: SQL supports transactions, allowing users to group multiple operations into a single unit of work that can be committed or rolled back.

Overall, SQL is a powerful tool for managing and interacting with relational databases, making it an essential skill for database administrators, developers, and data analysts.


SQL is divided into several categories based on the type of operations:

1. DDL (Data Definition Language):
Defines and modifies database structure.

CREATE (create tables, views)
ALTER (modify tables)
DROP (delete tables)
TRUNCATE (remove all rows)
2. DML (Data Manipulation Language):
Manages data within tables.

INSERT (add data)
UPDATE (modify data)
DELETE (remove data)
3. DQL (Data Query Language):
Queries data from tables.

SELECT (retrieve data)
4. DCL (Data Control Language):
Controls access to data.

GRANT (give permissions)
REVOKE (remove permissions)
5. TCL (Transaction Control Language):
Manages transactions.

COMMIT (save changes)
ROLLBACK (undo changes)
SAVEPOINT (set a point to rollback to)
